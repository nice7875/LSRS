# LSRS Dataset
![这里随便写文字](https://github.com/nice7875/LSRS/blob/main/LSRS.jpg)

We analyzed 20 publicly available datasets for RS scene classification, and excluded five sets with resolutions less than $200\times 200$. The integrated LSRS includes 113 RS scene categories, each with 198 images. Image sizes range from $200\times 200$ to $600\times 600$ pixels. Among the 15 datasets we used, 13 datasets include the `Residents' category. Among the 113 categories, images of 55 categories contain two or more different-source spatial domains.
